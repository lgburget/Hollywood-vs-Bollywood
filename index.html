							<h3>Interpretation</h3>
							<p>
								This topic analysis was really successful in detecting and segregating topics. We find a <strong> diversity of topics</strong> that span a wide range of lexicons.
								However a limitation to this analysis is that we are <strong> not able to detect the semantic relationship between the words</strong> in a given topic, nor can we infer the context in which they appear. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This plot, while being very informative, doesn't inform us about the use of said topics in each movie industry. 
								We extracted those topics from a dataset containing both movie industries, and we are not able to see 
								how they are used in each industry.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is why our next step is to explore the <stong>differences between the topics</stong> in each movie industry.
							</p>

								<h2>Topics distribution between movie industries</h2>

						</figure>
						
						<p>
							This plot shows the distribution of the mean normalized topic prevalence in each movie industry. We replaced topic number by
							words that are the most representative of the topic.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can see that the topics are not distributed uniformly across the movie industries. 
							For example, the topic containing <em>love, marriage, wedding</em> is significantly more prevalent in the Indian movie industry than in the American one. 
							We can also see that the topic containing <em>home, school, work, party</em> is more prevalent in the American movie industry than in the Indian one.
						</p>
						<p>
							Those differences could be due to underlying cultural differences between the two countries, but also could 
							be due to a bias in our dataset. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Topics inderectly inform us about the content of the movies through their summary, but so does their genre. How does the movie genre relate 
							to the topics covered in the movie? Can we identify differences between the movies industry 
							and refine our understanding of them through the intersection of the topics and the genre? 
						</p>


						<h1><em>"Everything everywhere all at once"</em></h1>
					
						<p class = "drop-cap">
							<strong>In this part, we offer you an in-depth study of 4 movie genres that we have selected to show you that the 
							notion of movie genre is not uniform across the globe.</strong> This part of the analysis can be explored in many
							ways and we encourage you to play with the different visualizations and the different genres. We also include 
							an analysis of one genre below the plot to help you understand how to navigate through the visualizations.

										Left pannel contains a plot of the t-SNE

									<p><strong>There are two visualization options</strong></p>
									<p><ul style = "font-size: smaller;">

											Clicking on <strong><u>Country</u></strong> will differentiate the movies by country. 
											Sticking with the color code we previously used, <strong style="color: rgb(242, 153, 0);" >Indian movies</strong>

											under-represented in the cluster compared to it's overall prevalence in our dataset.
										</li>
										<li>
											Clicking on the <strong><u>Country</u></strong> option will show you the <strong>country

								<strong>You will find many examples by navigating through this plot. We will detail one of them here</strong>

								<p>	
								Let's take the genre '<em><strong>romance</strong></em>'. The K-Means algorithm find 5 clusters. We can observe on the right panel by selecting 
								'Countries' that in the <strong style = "color: rgb(211, 180, 42);">cluster 4</strong>, that <strong>Indian movies are largely over-represented</strong>. On the 
								other hand, for the <strong style = "color: rgb(78, 85, 113);">cluster 3</strong>, in grey, it's the <strong>American movies that are largely over-represented</strong>.
								</p>
					
								<strong>Now let's focus on the standardized topic prevalence</strong>
								
								<p>
								We first see that the topic concerning women and
								relationship has a much higher prevalence in <strong style = "color: rgb(78, 85, 113);">cluster 3</strong> than in 
								<strong style = "color: rgb(211, 180, 42);">cluster 4</strong> although it
								remains important in the latter. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Secondly, we can see that the topic containing the words '<strong>father</strong>',
								and '<strong>mother</strong>' have a negative standardized prevalence in the <strong style ="color: rgb(78, 85, 113);">cluster 3</strong> whereas in  
								<strong style = "color: rgb(211, 180, 42);">cluster 4</strong> we have positive values. This indicates that there exists a sub-genre of romance 
								mainly present in India where the mother- and father-related topics are important. 
								</p>

								<p>
								Interestingly, <strong style = "color: rgb(139, 56, 114);">cluster 5</strong> has a negative standardized prevalence score
								in the topic related to women and relationships, and a positive score in the topic concerning escapes, shooting and trucks. This subgenre
								of <strong>romance</strong> movies is also proportionally more present in Indian cinema.
								</p>
								<p>
								It is also important to notice that there are  
								clusters, or sub-genres, that are represented more equally in both countries or with only a 
								slight dominance of one country like <strong style = "color: rgb(211, 81, 42);">cluster 1</strong>, 
								<strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong> or <strong style = "color: rgb(139, 56, 114);">cluster 5</strong>. 
								This shows that there are still some Indian and American romance that share a lot of features.

								Indian cinema, now a $2 billion industry, has much to offer.
								A treasure trove of stories and songs, its films are an art form that has grown to encompass every 
								facet of the nation's culture. From the epic historical films to the glossy masala movies, 
								from the arthouse parallel cinema to the song-and-dance spectaculars, Indian cinema has something 
								for everyone. In fact, it is the largest and most diverse film industry in the world, and it is now finding
