							Bollywood and Hollywood are very famous film industries nowadays. A westerner might assumes 
							that Bollywood has a long way to go before having the same importance in term of production, 
							compared to the American industry. When we look at some numbers, the Indian movie industry is 
							extremely famous in India, which has more than 1.4 billion people (more than 1/8 of the population 
							on Earth !). The Indian film industry’s export to other countries is also growing, notably in 
							China, and its productions have appeared in occidental cinemas more and more in recent years. 
							Therefore, it could be interesting to deconstruct this bias and ask ourselves : what assumptions 
							we have as westerners?
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;">
							<strong>For example, what comes to your mind when I talk about Indian cinema?</strong>
							<br>
								<em style="text-align: center;">Drama?</em>
								<em style="text-align: center;">Singing?</em>
								<em style="text-align: center;">Dancing?</em>
								<em style="text-align: center;">Romantic?</em>
								<em style="text-align: center;">Foreign?</em>
							</br>
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Unlike Hollywood, <strong>Bollywood is not a real place</strong>, but only a contraction 
							of Hollywood, the term representing the place of reference for American cinema, and Bombay, 
							the capital of India (now Mumbai) but also the historical base of Indian cinema. The association 
							between these two industries may lead one to believe that Indian cinema is strongly influenced by 
							American cinema. Thus, in this project we will look at the features of their films and analyze the 
							similarities and differences between these two world famous film factories. 
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
							<strong>Are Indian films heavily influenced by American production or do they have their own completely different identity?</strong> 
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: center;">
							To answer these questions, we use data from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which contains a 
							wealth of information on different films from around the world, as well as their summaries. 
							We will take the films from the American and Indian production and extract the most interesting
							features such as movie genre, topics spoken in the summaries or the characteristics of the 
							actors and then compare them to each other.
						</p>
						
						<p></p>
						<p></p>

						<h1 class="entry__header"><strong>Getting familiar with the data</strong></h1>

						<h1 style="text-align: center;">Movie genres</h1>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/plots/movie_genres.png" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							As the plot shows, "<em>drama</em>" is the prominent movie genre in both American and 
							Indian movies. 
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							American movies seems to have a better distribution of different genres than 
							Indian movies, that are more focused around "drama".
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: center;">
								<u>Some questions arises here :</u>
								<br><em>Is American drama the same as Indian drama ?</em> 
								<br><em>What if these notions are completely different in both culture ?</em>
								<br><strong>We will investigate these questions further towards the end of our analysis.</strong>
						</p>
						 
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Furthermore, both of Indian and American movies have a large number of movie 
							genres, so it could be interesting to select a restricted group of movie genres
							that allows better and more precise results for our further analysis.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							For example, genre like "<em>world cinema</em>" seems rather not specific enough to 
							categorize the movies. Indeed, the term "<em>world cinema</em>" refers to films produced 
							outside of the United States and Europe, or to films that are made in a 
							particular country or region but are intended for international audiences. 
							World cinema includes a wide variety of film genres, such as action, drama, 
							comedy, romance, horror, and more. It encompasses films from many different 
							countries and cultures, each with their own unique traditions and styles of 
							storytelling.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							It is rather reducer to put every genre produced outside of the Occident in a 
							global term like "<em>world cinema</em>". <strong>We hence a lot of information about the
							spectrum of differences and different themes of movies produced around the 
							world</strong>. This could be another bias that our data set has, on the fact that 
							Indian movies are not represented the same way as American movies.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							This could explain the fact that there is more movie genres attributed to 
							American movies than Indian movies, although we have to be careful of the 
							fact that we have less Indian movies than American movies.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Finally, some genres are similar to each other or some of them include 
							other genres (e.g. "action/aventure"). For these types of genres, we 
							separated them and re-classified them in each one of the single genres.
						</p>

						<h1 style="text-align: center;">Movie runtime</h1>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/plots/movie_runtime.png" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" alt="">
						</figure>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							We notice that Indian movies have a tendency to be longer (by ~48 minutes) and 
						than American movies.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							There could be a bias in our dataset, because early Indian cinema might be 
							under-represented compared to early American cinema.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Although we can add that in general, Indian movies tend to have more 
							elaborate plots and subplots, and they often include songs and dance sequences, 
							which can contribute to their longer runtime. This is often a characteristic of 
							Bollywood movies, in particular, which are known for their elaborate storylines 
							and large casts. American movies, on the other hand, may be more focused on 
							action and special effects, which may not require as much screen time. 
						</p>


						<h1 style="text-align: center;">Actor data</h1>
						<h2>Age and gender</h2>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/plots/gender_age_indian_vs_usa_cut.png" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							We can observe that there is a significant difference (we computed a t-test
							between the two data and have a significant p-values, c.f. notebook) between 
							actress in Indian and in American. The actresses are younger in the Indian movies
							than in the American ones.
						</p>
							
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							It might mainly be driven by the sample size, but we can propose some possible
							factors to explain why Indian actresses might be younger than the American 
							actresses:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li style="text-align: justify">
								<strong>Cultural preferences</strong>: In some cultures, including Indian culture, youth and
								beauty are often prized and valued highly. This may lead to a preference for
								younger actresses in the film industry.
							</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify">
								<strong>The demands of the film industry</strong> : Acting in movies can be physically
								demanding, and younger actresses may be better able to handle the 
								demands of long shooting schedules and demanding roles.
							</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify">
								<strong>Physical demands of acting</strong>: In some cases, certain roles may require 
								actresses to have a certain appearance or physicality, which may be more 
								common in younger actresses.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							It is also worth noting that there is a wide range of ages among actresses 
							in Indian movies, and many actresses in India continue to work in the 
							film industry well into their 40s, 50s, and beyond.
						</p>
							

						<h2>Number of films per actors</h2>
						<figure>
							<img src="images/plots/number_films_per_actor_gender_cut.png" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" alt="">
						</figure>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							We probably have a bias in our dataset in the quantity of information we 
							have in our dataset regarding the American films. 
							We are far more likely to have the names of actors that make a single 
							brief appearance in an American film. 
							However, regarding the other extreme, we can see that there is a lot more
							ultra-prolific Indian film actors than American film actors.
						</p>
	
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							In both film industries we see however that most of the hyper-prolific 
							actors are males, which is probably linked to the difference in career 
							prospects with age.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Also, there is some evidence to suggest that female actresses tend to 
							have fewer opportunities to play leading roles in movies than male actors
							in both Hollywood and Bollywood. Indeed, in 2015, the Center for the 
							Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University 
							published a report titled "It's a Man's (Celluloid) World," which found
							that women made up just 12% of protagonists in the top 100 grossing 
							films of 2014.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							This phenomenon, known as the "gender gap" or the "female movie deficit," 
							refers to the underrepresentation of women in the film industry, both in 
							front of and behind the camera.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							There are also more factors that may contribute to the gender gap in the
							film industry, including societal and cultural biases, the lack of diverse
							and complex female characters in film scripts, and the limited number of
							female directors and producers.
						</p>

						<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: justify;">
							This is once again an angle that could be included in further analysis 
							regarding trends and film success (ratings) prediction.
						</p>

							<h3>Interpretation</h3>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								This topic analysis was really successful in detecting and segregating topics. We find a <strong> diversity of topics</strong> that span a wide range of lexicons.
								However a limitation to this analysis is that we are <strong> not able to detect the semantic relationship between the words</strong> in a given topic, nor can we infer the context in which they appear. 
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								This plot, while being very informative, doesn't inform us about the use of said topics in each movie industry. 
								We extracted those topics from a dataset containing both movie industries, and we are not able to see 
								how they are used in each industry.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify">
								This is why our next step is to explore the <stong>differences between the topics</stong> in each movie industry.

							This plot shows the distribution of the mean normalized topic prevalence in each movie industry. We replaced topic number by
							words that are the most representative of the topic.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							We can see that the topics are not distributed uniformly across the movie industries. 
							For example, the topic containing <em>love, marriage, wedding</em> is significantly more prevalent in the Indian movie industry than in the American one. 
							We can also see that the topic containing <em>home, school, work, party</em> is more prevalent in the American movie industry than in the Indian one.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Those differences could be due to underlying cultural differences between the two countries, but also could 
							be due to a bias in our dataset. 
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Topics inderectly inform us about the content of the movies through their summary, but so does their genre. How does the movie genre relate 
							to the topics covered in the movie? Can we identify differences between the movies industry 
							and refine our understanding of them through the intersection of the topics and the genre?

								<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;"><strong>You will find many examples by navigating through this plot. We will detail one of them here</strong></p>

								<p style="text-align: justify">	
								Let's take the genre '<em><strong>comedy</strong></em>'. The K-Means algorithm was set to 4 clusters. We can observe on the right panel by selecting 
								<strong><u>Countries</u></strong> that in the <strong style = "color: rgb(204, 79, 21);">cluster 1</strong>, that <strong>Indian movies</strong> are largely over-represented. On the 
								other hand, for the <strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong>, it's the <strong>American movies</strong> that are largely over-represented.
								</p>
					
								<p style="text-align: center; font-size: larger;">
									<strong>Now let's focus on the standardized topic prevalence.</strong> 
									<br style="font-size: smaller;"><em style="font-size: smaller;">(You can access topic differences by clicking on the box with the downward arrow on the top left of the right-side plot and selecting)</em></br>
								</p>
								
								<p style="text-align: justify">
									The most important topic in the <strong style = "color: rgb(204, 79, 21);">cluster 1</strong> is the topic centered on family and daily life whereas in the 
									<strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong> this topic doesn't seem to be more covered than the average. Moreover we see that in 
									<strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong> the most important topic is about ships, aliens and discoveries, and in <strong style = "color: rgb(204, 79, 21);">cluster 1</strong> this topic is much 
									less present than on average (negative mean normalized topic prevalence). 
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify">
									We can deduce from this analysis that in India, more comedies are made
									involving a family's daily life and very rarely add a sci-fi/adventure component.in the US, comedies mixed with some action seem to be very frequent. However, it is also important 
									to notice that there are also other clusters, or sub-genres, that are represented equally in both 
									countries like <strong style = "color: rgb(168, 58, 135);">cluster 0</strong> or <strong style = "color: rgb(78, 85, 113);">cluster 3</strong>. 
									<strong>This shows that there are some sub-genres that are equally represented in India and the US.</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify">
									We can also notice than when investigating the differences in the <strong><u>Actor</u></strong> visualization
									 between <strong style = "color: rgb(204, 79, 21);">cluster 1</strong>
									and <strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong>, women happen to represent a smaller proportion of
									the cast in the <strong style = "color: rgb(59, 150, 57);">cluster 2</strong> than in the <strong style = "color: rgb(204, 79, 21);">cluster 1</strong>.

						<h1 class="entry_title" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
						<p style="text-align: justify"> 
							With our study, we can determine that “Bollywood” and “Hollywood” films are 
							surely different. By making a first analysis on different characteristics, we 
							see that they accumulate differences notably on their genres, actors features 
							and runtimes. For the topics talked in movies, they have similarities but some
							subjects are more present in Indian movies such as family or wedding, while 
							American movies have more stories about school or parties. This analysis shows 
							that there is a cultural difference in American and Indian cinema, while they 
							have the same labels as the genre, for example.
						</p>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Indeed, we have seen that the genre drama the most common genre in America and 
							India. However, in the last part of our analysis, we see that these type of movies
							have similar topics keywords for some of the clusters, but also have their 
							differences. Indeed, two clusters stand out for each industry. We have observed 
							that a type of Indian drama is more focused around love, romance and relationship, 
							whereas a type of American drama is more revolved around action with crime and 
							violence (c.f. t-SNE results and country proportion/topic repartition on drama 
							genre, cluster id 0 and 3). It is furthermore interesting to see that drama has
							a lot of subgenres in it and that there is a whole spectrum of different 
							stories within it.
						</p>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							This result supports the idea that the movies industry culture of two radically
							different countries is rather difficult to compare and quite complex, in the 
							sense of capturing the subtle difference that lies between the two cultures.
						</p>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							It is hence reducing to try to label each movies (which is, to some extension 
							a representation of the country culture : c. f. « Movies and Culture: The Role 
							of Films in Shaping Societal Norms and Values » by Jennifer A. Fritsche, published
							in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology in 2016.) and have a meaningful,
							sense-making comparison. It was important here for us to rather observe the
							differences and to deconstruct our biases towards a different culture and try 
							to take a step back. It was extremely fulfilling to have a critical view of how
							the Hollywood or American heavily influences western culture 
							(c.f. "The Americanization of European Cinemas: Hollywood's Influence on 
							Local Film Industries" by Mark Jancovich, published in the journal Screen in 
							2002.).
						</p>
						

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							In addition, we have to keep in mind the bias that we have in the dataset. 
							Indeed, there are many more American films than Indian ones in our data, 
							although the Indian industry is known for its large number of films produced. 
							The only films in our data are potentially the tip of the iceberg. We also may
							have only the famous films which is not representative of the entire Indian 
							film culture. To support the idea of the strong influence of the American movie
							industry, the (reducing) genre 'world cinema' shows that the genre designation 
							of Indian films is made by Westerner.
						</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">
							Finally, we started this analysis by having the assumption that Bollywood, by the 
							essence of its name, was inevitably influenced and shaped by Hollywood. Going 
							through the analysis, learning more and more about Indian movie industry was 
							enlightening and we realized how much this two industries can be considered as
							entities with their own characters.
						</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify">
								Indian cinema, now a $2 billion industry, has much to offer.
								A treasure trove of stories and songs, its films are an art form that has grown to encompass every 
								facet of the nation's culture. From the epic historical films to the glossy masala movies, 
								from the arthouse parallel cinema to the song-and-dance spectaculars, Indian cinema has something 
								for everyone. In fact, it is the largest and most diverse film industry in the world, and it is now finding 
								an increasingly global audience.
